# Demo Application

This is a demo application, displaying the basic Spring Boot features and JPA.
It includes an in memory SQL database.

## Dependencies

- Docker
- Java 11
- Maven

## Build

	mvn clean package

To build a docker image, run:

	mvn clean package jib:dockerBuild

Then run using docker:

	docker run -p 8080:8080 demo:latest

## Using

A main page is available at localhost:8080.

OpenAPI docs (probably the most useful bit of the demo, other than the code) at localhost:8080/swagger-ui.html.

The endpoints named "demoes" are auto generated by Spring Data Repositories.

The endpoints at /api/hero are configured by the application, but basically accomplish the same thing.
