# Demo Application

This is a demo application, displaying the basic Spring Boot features and JPA.
It includes an in memory SQL database.

## Dependencies

- Docker
- Java 11
- Maven

## Build

` mvn clean package `

## To build a docker image, run:

` mvn clean package jib:dockerBuild `

## Then run using docker:

- The command: ` docker run -d --mount type=bind,Source="[Where the config file is on local system]",target=/home/data -p [ports you want to use] -it shippingappb:latest `
- The command in example: ` docker run -d --mount type=bind,Source="D:\Development\ShippingAppB\Main\SpringExample\demo-spring-app-master\config\",target=/home/data -p 8080:8080 -it shippingappb:latest `

## Using

A main page is available at localhost:8080.

OpenAPI docs (probably the most useful bit of the demo, other than the code) at localhost:8080/swagger-ui.html.

The endpoints named "demoes" are auto generated by Spring Data Repositories.

The endpoints at /api/hero are configured by the application, but basically accomplish the same thing.
